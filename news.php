  <b> 2012-11-13 </b> - Version 3.2.2
  Minor bugfixes and improvements still rolling out to gatherling.  Hosts of events have it a bit nicer now,
  and some persistent bugs are fixed.  There's a lot happening behind the scenes, but I promise there will be
  some more player-visible stuff coming soon.
  <ul>
    <li> Bugs! Squashed! </li>
    <li> Host tools have been updated a lot, especially in the admin of matches. </li>
    <li> We now record which round a player dropped in, which should be useful. </li>
  </ul>
 </p>

  <b> 2012-09-02 </b> - Version 3.2.0
  The big update to Gatherling is going well, with things working good for the couple of events.  Also ended up
  introducing some bugs as expected with such a large update, so this was mostly a bugsquashing update.
  <ul>
    <li> Bugsquashing! Players can register easier now. </li>
    <li> Enhancements to the host tools so that they work better. </li>
    <li> Some more enhancements to make things look better. </li>
   </ul>
 </p>
