  I am glad to say that finally, we have a big update to gatherling, and it's thanks to longtimegone and Dabil
  who have worked very hard on an update which enables a form of pairing within the Gatherling system.
  There are probably a few bugs with this system that still haven't been worked out, but they have been testing
  it for TPDC for a while and with some other events and it works okay.  It is now available for hosts
  that want to have an alternative to running things in DCI-R.  The pairing is not exactly the same yet,
  but it will be updated to be as much like DCI-R in the future.
  <ul>
    <li> Hosts can pair, re-pair, drop players, etc. from Gatherling. </li>
    <li> Standings are updated automatically as matches go on. </li>
    <li> Players can report their own match scores. </li>
    <li> Decks are now not shown until after an event is complete to encourage deck entry. </li>
    <li> Lots of bug fixes, but also probably some new bugs because of new functionality!  Please don't
         hesitate to contact us in the <a href="http://forums.pdcmagic.com/viewforum.php?f=15">Gatherling Forum</a>.</li>
   </ul>

  It's an update!  This time it is mostly bugfixes, but maybe there will be some time in the future to
  make some more improvements.  We've gotten a bunch of help from the community (thanks Dabil) to make
  some cleanup happen under the hood.
  <ul>
    <li> Players with no tournament entries can now login and work fine </li>
    <li> Lots of under-the-hood stuff made better </li>
  </ul>
