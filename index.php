  If you thought that the last time between updates was long, I have news for you.  At any rate, I've been given some time to get some stuff done again and I have been able to fix some bugs and provide some new functionality for everyone.
  <ul>
    <li> You can now pre-register for events if the event host allows it.  More features to be added soon related to this. </li>
    <li> Deck search is re-enabled now, so you can find popular decks and decks with specific cards. </li>
    <li> Event hosts will find some fancy UI improvements in the back end. </li>
    <li> You can't make a deck without a name anymore. </li>
    <li> A bunch of backend bugfixes and improvements. </li>
   </ul>
 </p>

  Wow, long time with no update.  Backend improvements mostly, and bugfixes for everyone.
  <ul>
    <li> Super new players now can actually do stuff before they have a match. </li>
    <li> Standard events show up with a format correctly now on the events page. </li>
    <li> Events page is standard throughout the site pointing to gatherling now. </li>
    <li> Should be many less issues with players and capitalization of names. </li>
    <li> "Rogue" as a decktype has been renamed to "Unclassified" to more accurately reflect reality. </li>
  </ul>
 </p>
